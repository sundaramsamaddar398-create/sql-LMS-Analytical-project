# sql-LMS-Analytical-project
Developed an analytical SQL project for a Learning Management System (LMS), exploring tables like users, courses, modules, enrollments, and assessments to generate insights on learner engagement, course popularity, and performance trends, showcasing strong query design and business relevance.

📘 LMS Analytical SQL Project

🔎 Project Overview
This project focuses on building an analytical SQL framework for a Learning Management System (LMS). The goal was to design queries and insights that help track learner engagement, course performance, and assessment outcomes. By leveraging relational tables such as user, courses, modules, content, categories, enrollments, assessments, and assessment_submission, the project demonstrates how raw LMS data can be transformed into actionable intelligence.

🗂️ Key Features
- Schema Exploration: Queries across core LMS entities (users, courses, modules, assessments, enrollments).
- Course Analytics: Identify most popular courses, enrollment trends, and category-level performance.
- Assessment Insights: Evaluate average scores, pass/fail rates, and assessment difficulty.
- Learner Progress Tracking: Measure individual learner activity, including courses enrolled and assessments attempted.
- Engagement Metrics: Highlight dropout rates, completion percentages, and module-level engagement.

📊 Business Relevance
This project illustrates how educational institutions or e-learning platforms can:
- Monitor student performance and identify at-risk learners.
- Optimize course design by analyzing module-level engagement.
- Improve assessment quality by tracking difficulty and average scores.
- Support strategic decisions around curriculum planning and learner retention.

⚙️ Tech Stack
- SQL: Core language for querying and analysis
- Relational Schema: LMS tables (user, courses, modules, etc.)
- Analytical Queries: Aggregations, joins, and KPI-focused views

✨ Outcome
The project delivers a portfolio-ready analytical SQL solution that transforms LMS data into meaningful insights. It showcases strong data modeling, query design, and storytelling skills — bridging technical execution with business impact.
